**30-seconds of Notes**

Immediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds — no more, no less — to write down the most important points. All notes in detail will be given to you. If they aren't written by me, then they are available online. What is hardest is learning, using, becoming fluent with, and reflecting on this content.

**From novice to expert**

A pyschological framework called the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition lays out the characteristics of various levels of expertise:

1. Novice

  - Rigid adherence to rules or plans
  - Little situational perception
  - No (or limited) discretionary judgment

2. Advanced Beginner

  - Guidelines for action based on attributes and aspects, which are all equal and separate
  - Limited situational perception

3. Competent

  - Conscious deliberate planning
  - Standardized and routine procedures

4. Proficient

  - Sees situations holistically rather than as aspects
  - Perceives deviations from normal patterns
  - Uses maxims for guidance, whose meanings are contextual

5. Expert

  - No longer relies on rules, guidelines or maxims
  - Intuitive grasp of situations
  - Analytic approach used only in novel situations

**Communication**

If you are sick, running late, have to take care of a car, etc... ping me directly on Slack. Failing to do so will only hurt your progress in this class.

Also, you need to ask questions. If you aren't asking questions, you either aren't involved/paying attention or you aren't understanding enough to ask a question. The course will move unreasonably fast, and I plan my classes assuming that you'll interrupt me to ask questions.

**Automating, Scheduling, and Decision Fatigue**

Check out [this posting](http://blog.pickcrew.com/5-alternative-ways-to-manage-time/) for some fresh ideas on time management.

We are hardwired to need breaks every 90-120 minutes. Schedule your energy, not your time. Block out parts of your day for exercise, for reading (fiction), for cooking, for family. Three hours of coding with a lively mind and healthy body are more effective than eight hours of consecutive zombie coding. 

Group similar activities. if you need to do emails, do them in batches. If you need to do an assignment, do it without looking around at websites, checking Facebook/Twitter, or reading emails.

There is no excuse to not work on high-priority items first. Mark Twain reminds us that "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." 


**Focus**

Devote all of your energy to one task at a time. Multi-tasking has a cost, especially when programming. TURN ON DND MODE.

Don't check email until lunch. Rather than checking your email dozens of times throughout the day, dedicate two blocks of time (one at the beginning and one at the end of the day).

**Blogging and Branding**

Sign up for an account on http://medium.com. You will be asked to regularly blog, reflecting on your voyage and trials here at The Iron Yard. You will also be asked to, on occasion, reflect on a reading, on an assignment, or on a video as a homework assignment itself.

Writing about code, about being a developer, about a tool, and so forth gives you leverage. You learn to put into words how you emotionally feel, you understand and reflect, you meditate. Those thoughts, ideas, and takeaways are in essence "pre-meditated" and prepared so that when you rub shoulders with and interview with employers, clients, and customers, you have something eloquent enough to deliver, and memorable enough to recall.
