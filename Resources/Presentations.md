#Presentations

##Give a talk to your classmates on one of the given topics listed below. 

###Tips and Requirements

- Use at least one, ideally all three, of the following techniques:
  - live coding
  - whiteboarding
  - interactive exercises

- Do research! I'll be thrilled to hear you echo what I've taught in class, but you should be going beyond this for your presentation. Read blogs, tutorials, books, essays, and anything else you can get your hands on to get a broad and deep perspective on your topic. 

- ***Learn more than you plan to present***, so that you can distill down your knowledge to its key points, and so that you can answer questions that your classmates might have for you after your talk. And don't just dump the information on us. Take us there. Tell us a story. 

- Make sure that the way you define your topic passes ***the grandma test***. Can you explain it to your grandma? If not, you don't really understand it.
