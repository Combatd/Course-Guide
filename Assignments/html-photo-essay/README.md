#Photo Grid

###Objectives:

To become familiar with:
  - The default properties of HTML elements
  - The differences between the `block` and `inline` values of the `display` property
  - The art of nesting and organizing HTML elements

###The task:

Recreate the page shown in the gif below.

![](./photogrid.gif)

###Notes and Requirements: 

  - The images must be 100px X 100px (note: you can simply use the lorempixel url for this, i.e. `http://lorempixel.com/100/100/`.
  - The image grid must contain no more than 3 images per row, with at least 3 rows. 
  - You may NOT use `<br>` tags.
  - Clicking the link next to an image should refresh the page, replacing all images in the grid with new images.
  - The *content* of the heading, intro, copyright, etc., doesn't matter (obviously I've used placeholders), but the layout and formatting do. Even the bolding of your name at the bottom.
