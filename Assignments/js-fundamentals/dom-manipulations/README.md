# Event Listeners

## Instructions

Description and demo of each task is here. You'll need to do the following:

Clone this repo into a folder on your own hard drive.
change the remote url with git remote set-url origin <url for your remote repo> (so it points to a repo on your github account, not mine.)
edit main.js so that all the tasks outlined on the page are performed as requested.
submit a link to a live site on gh-pages showcasing your work.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Build and test your familiarity with DOM events and event handler functions. 
* Exercise your abilities to read, write, and otherwise manipulate the DOM. 


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  - the `constructors.js` file
  - a branch called `gh-pages`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors


## Hard Mode
In the `constructors.js` there is a bonus question at the bottom. This is your hard mode.


## Notes

If you are finished with your normal mode before 7pm I would urge you to try the hard mode.
