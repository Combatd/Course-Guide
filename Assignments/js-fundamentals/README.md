#Fundamentals

The assignents in this folder will build your JavaScript fundamentals from the ground up. 

For each javascript file contained, your task is to:

  - Copy the file into your own GitHub repo.
  - Edit the file so that all of the assertions pass. I should be able to run your modified file using `node <filename>.js` 
  and see absolutely no output on the console.
  - Upload the completed file to GitHub and submit a link.
