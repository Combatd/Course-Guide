#Fundamentals

The assignents in this folder will build your JavaScript fundamentals from the ground up. 

For each javascript file contained, your task is to:

  - Copy the file onto your computer using the bash `curl` command and the carat `>` to redirect output. For example: 
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-Houston-Front-End-Engineering/Course-Guide/master/Assignments/js-fundamentals/types-functions-callbacks.js > types-functions-callbacks.js
  - Edit the file so that all of the assertions pass. I should be able to run your modified file using `node <filename>.js` 
  and see absolutely no output on the console.
  - Upload the completed file to GitHub and submit a link.
