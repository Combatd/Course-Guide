Deliverables:

- a git repo containing:
    - an `index.html` file
    - a `styles` folder
        - `style.css`
    - an `images` folder
        - any images you used in your design

- a publicly visible web page on gh-pages

I will be checking to see that all of these deliverables were submitted by midnight tonight. Good luck!
